                    I programmed majority of the backend for this tool. <br><br>Firstly, I focused on transforming propositional logic statements into truth tables for the user to optionally view. <br>Secondly, fully simplifying expressions into conjunctive and disjunctive form. This would then be the answer to the question box which the user has to fill in. <br><br>The tool has two types of questions. Either, you could make a txt file with the questions and the tool would read from the file and display those questions to the user. Or the user could enter their own question and attempt it themselves.

                    When calculating the best possible move, there are 40 possibilities. The programme has internal factors which weight the strength of each move. For example, how many holes would a move create? Or the aggregate height that adding a block would have?
                    The programme would internally clone the game board, then try out all 40 possible move combinations. It will assess the strength of each move according to the internal weighting factors.
                    I was manually tuning the importance of these factors, so some factors would be given priority over others.

These special characters allow the program to detect when a note finishes and when the next note starts!

                <p>Chess was one of the sports which i competed in from a young age. I represented my county (Berkshire) in national tournaments. As well is competing in many individual tournaments and winning a number of both team and individual accolades.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Whilst playing chess, I always enjoyed playing football in my free-time. This is when I decided to join a club. During these years I grasped key teamwork attributes. For example, covering for my teammate, supporting them during the match, or even building relationships with them such that we become friends outside of football. These characteristic have become second-nature to me in day-to-day life. Although I left the club many years ago, I continue to casually play football very regularly since.</p>

                <p>I also played lots of cricket in my free-time. After leaving my football club I joined Sonning Cricket Club. Here, I quickly became captain and worked my way to the county squad. Although this endevour did not last long it was a great experience. It led me to joining Wokingham Cricket Club, where I again became captain and enjoyed playing until my GCSE year. Now, despite not playing for a club I often practice with my brother.</p>

I find being able to play a whole raft of extra-curricular activities is a great ice-breaker when meeting new people, also a good way to spend time with friends.</p>
